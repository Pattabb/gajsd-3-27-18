/* Making a favorites list: DOM manipulation

- When the user clicks the submit button, take the value they've typed
  into the input box and add it to the list (hint: appendChild)

- Also, when a new item is added to the list, clear the input box.

Bonus:

When the user clicks the button without typing anything, alert the user with alert('your message here')
Hint: the `value` property of an empty input box is an empty string: ""
