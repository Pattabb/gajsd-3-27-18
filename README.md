# GA JSD: Course Website and Notes

A static web portal and notes for General Assembly's part-time JavaScript Development (JDS) course.

### Setup

1. If deploying through Surge, add a `CNAME` file containing your desired URL in the `public` directory ([more info](http://surge.sh/help/remembering-a-domain)).

2. Sass files for styling the Reveal.js slides live at `assets/sass` and are compiled to `public/css/build.css` by running `./bin/sass` from root.

### Workflow

You will notice that the `materials` and `notes` directories exist both at the root of this project, as well as inside of the `public` directory.

As the two directories at the project root are not exposed to the public, I use them as a workplace; once the notes and materials for a particular class are complete, I move the associated files into the public directory.
